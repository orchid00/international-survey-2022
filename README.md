***Collaboration tool to create surveys and analyse data about Research Software Engineers around the world***

This repository is used to create and analyse international surveys. It use csv files to store questions and answers that are later transformed into a limesurvey TSV file. The analysis are using python and are shared within jupyter notebooks.


In **2016** the Software Sustainability Institute ran the first survey of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) - the people who write code in academia. This produced the first insight into the demographics, job satisfaction, and practices of RSEs. To support and broaden this work, the Institute will run the UK survey every year and - it is hoped - will expand the survey so that insight and comparison can be made across different countries. Ultimately, we hope that these results, the anonymised version of which will all be open licensed, will act as a valuable resource to understand and improve the working conditions for RSEs.

In **2017** we also surveyed Canadian RSEs and we added four further countries, Germany, Netherlands, South Africa and USA. 
Our thanks to our partners: Scott Henwood (Canada), Stephan Janosch and Martin Hammitzsch (Germany), Ben van Werkhoven and Tom Bakker (Netherlands), Anelda van der Walt (South Africa) and Daniel Katz and Sandra Gesing (USA).

In **2018** we have worked differently and created a survey for all countries (rather than one survey for each ones). 



## Published results
We publish the results under the form of notebooks. All surveys have an attached 'public.csv' file. Theses files have been cleaned of all sensitive data. Therefore, the jupyter notebooks show some results that are not contained in the 'public.csv'.

## Composition of the survey
The [base questions](https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey/blob/master/survey_creation/2018/questions.csv) for the survey were tailored to meet the requirements of each country. They covered ten subjects:
   1. **Demographics**: traditional social and economic questions, such as gender, age, salary and education.
   1. **Coding**: how much code do RSEs write, how often, and for whom.
   1. **Employment**: questions about where RSEs work and in which disciplines.
   1. **Current contract**: understanding stability of employment by questioning the type of employment contract RSEs receive.
   1. **Previous employment**: understanding routes into the profession the reasons for choosing it.
   1. **Collaboration and training**: who RSEs work with, how many people they work with, and the training they conduct.
   1. **Publications**: do RSEs contribute to publications and are they acknowledged?
   1. **Sustainability and tools**: testing, bus factor, technical handover. Also which tools they are using
   1. **Job satisfaction**: what do RSEs think about their job and their career?
   1. **Network**: how do RSEs meet and gain representation?
These subjects are not necessarily  investigated under this order, neither published with that order.
