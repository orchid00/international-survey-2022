# International collaboration for survey

The starting point is the already made survey the SSI conducted in UK during march 2016.

## Modify and adapting questions and answers to different organisation/country

There is three types of modifications that is possible to do 
* **Adding/removing questions** to take into account the specificity of the country or situation that were not taken into account. In that case, it could be situations that are not encounter else where or that a similar situation is shared among countries. In that case the questions and the answers have to be made from scratch. This can be also applied for omission in the UK survey. Therefore it is a possibility to enhance the original survey

* **Adapting the answers to the country** - Some answers are not valid in other countries. The most obvious example is the list of university. In that case a new set of answers has to be created that is independent to the others versions

* **Creating correspondances between countries** - This last type of modification is the most difficult but essential. It is to create correspondance between countries. The straight forward example is with salary. We need to create scales of salary. We have to build different salary scales that can be easily compared in the future.
 
 
For every questions that imply a fixed list of anwers, a spefic csv file can be found in the /listAnswers. Any adapted and newly created list of answers need to follow the same format to make the adaptation and reuse easier. 


## Technical solution

We decided to use the open source [limesurvey](http://www.limesurvey.org) service to create the survey. This solution present advantage in term of price and variety of hosting solutions. Also it is easier to share survey template that can be later modified by each organisation/countries. The template is in FOLDER. 

The collaboration will be done on this repository to ensure access to the information for every one and respect the principle of transparency. However, on early stage, the repository is going to be set up on *private mode* until everyone agrees on going on *public*. 


## Question mandatory

The first iteration of the survey did not set up the question as *mandatory*. During the analysis we realised that was a mistake. It is impossible to distinguish the NA to other type of answer. It is then strongly recommended to set up all question to mandatory, execpt for sensible question such as gender - salary. 
 
 
# Details on questions

This section lists different identified issues or concerns about specifics sections in the survey. 

## Reasons to leave previous position

With that section we intended to know why the respondents would have leave their previous work in private sector. We build the items based on several lists of the mosts shared reasons to leave the jobs
 
 
## Work indicators

In the RSE survey we used

Note that in the template the questions are in order to make it easier to work with them. However they need to be randomised.


## RSE definition issue

This section is essential to tailor the answer to the population of interest only. However, the definition of RSE is difficult because it is a relatively new role and there is no consensus on it yet. 

For the previous study, we named the population **Research Software Engineer (RSEs)** because it is the term adopted in UK. We know that this term is not possible in Canada. Therefore this needs to be adopted to the most common used term in the respective country/organisation. 

The questions we used to define RSE come from the [UKRSE website](http://www.rse.ac.uk/who.html). However, we removed items they were obviously biaised toward a negative definition of the role as well as the one created on the assumption that RSE are post-doc. Despite the terminology a work on the definition should be done to include more possible variety of RSE around organisations.
There should also have a way to distinguishes RSE among themselves, which type of coding, work and assistance they provide. The first step toward such distinctions should be done by asking open questions on and analyse it later to see if tendencies are emerging.
 
 
## Contribution to papers

We added four questions to know in which extend the RSE are recognised for their paper contribution. This section should have more items about other types of contribution. It would be interesting to know in which extend their code is cited in the papers and how it is done. 

## Good practices

We included two questions to know more about the good practice 


## Academia and private sector

We are aware that some RSEs can work in private sector and still contribute to research. We are not studying that aspect in UK because our mission is about the RSEs working in academy. As consequence, the questions are not adapted for the private sector but a discussion on that aspect is needed. 


## Gender

This question is quite difficult to create in order to capture the different genders that exists. However, the population will not be necessarily big and the study is not gender centred so we decided to only keep *woman* *man* *other* *prefer not to say*. The category *other* will capture all the potential diversity without creating too much different categories that would have to be grouped together for the analysis. However, it may still be a good option to include all categories or at least a blank field. In that case, adding the option *Trans* and *FREE TEXT*, should be enough. In the present template we left as we did for our own survey.
