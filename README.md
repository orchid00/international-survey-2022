# International collaboration for survey

In 2016 the Software Sustainability Institute ran the first survey of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) - the people who write code in academia. This produced the first insight into the demographics, job satisfaction, and practices of RSEs. To support and broaden this work, the Institute will run the UK survey every year and - it is hoped - will expand the survey so that insight and comparison can be made across different countries. Ultimately, we hope that these results, the anonymised version of which will all be open licensed, will act as a valuable resource to understand and improve the working conditions for RSEs.

In 2017, we have conducted surveys in the UK and in Canada. We now have German and Dutch collaborators, and we are looking at expanding into Norway, South Africa and the US.

# Working with us on a new survey

The following are instructions on how to work with us on a new survey. Below, you will find more detail about the contents of this repository and how the surveys are conducted.

## Creating a new survey

We are flexible to adapting the survey to your needs. However, we also want to make the inter-country analysis as easy as possible. For this reason, we have a few guiding principles that - in a perfect world - we can agree to stick to:

1. We make as few adaptations as possible to the core questions
1. We apply for ethics approval at the University of Southampton (where Simon Hettrick and Olivier Philippe are based) to run the survey.
1. We run the survey under the University of Southampton's Limesurvey account so that all data is processed in the same way (and we pay for it)
1. We store all anonymised data on Zenodo under a Creations Commons By Attribution licence with ourselves and yourself as joint authors
1. We destroy the data set with with non-anonymised data (i.e. those with email addresses) because it's no longer necessary

What we need from you:

1. Locate the directory related to your country's survey in [survey creation](https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey/tree/master/survey_creation).
1. In your country directory, you will find three files
   1. listAnswers directory: containing csv file that contain answers for questions where a list of potential answers is presented
   1. Text directory: containing md files that contain the welcome and end message for the survey
   1. question csv file: containing a csv that contains the core questions for your survey
1. Review the core questions (in "questions_<country>_<year>.csv") and decide if there are any changes (additions, removals or edits) that you think will be necessary. Simon Hettrick and Olivier Philippe at the Institute will organise a discussion with you to discuss these changes. (For more detail on this files, see the [description below](#explanation-of-the-columns-in-questions-csv))
1. The listAnswers folder contains csv files that hold information that is relevant to the UK (e.g. all UK universities, standard UK academic salary ranges in pounds). We need you to provide answers that are relevant to your country (e.g. all German universities, or standard Dutch academic salary ranges in Euros).
1. The Text directory contains the welcome and end messages that are presented at the start and end of the survey. Please review these and decide on whether you are happy with the content
1. Now that the content of the questions, answers and welcome and end text is to everyone's approval, we need you to translate the text into your native language(s).
1. Once we are all happy that the survey is ready, you will disseminate the survey in your own country

Where to put translated text:

1. Translated questions should be added to the "questions_<country>_<year>.csv" under one or more of the columns "Trans lang 1", "Trans lang 2", "Trans lang 3" (contact us if you have more than three national languages).
1. Translated welcome and end text should replace the English-language version in the appropriate files in the Text directory.
1. Translated lists of answers should replace the English-language versions in the csv files held in the listAnswers directory. If multiple languages are to be contained in the file, please separate translated answers with semi-colons.

## Explanation of the columns in questions csv

We now provide some more detail about the columns in the questions csv file. You will not need most of this information, but we want to provide it for comprehensiveness.

* **section**: The survey is split into sections (6 usually) each of which contains a number of questions.

* **code**: This is the unique ID for each question. It mandatory because it is used to compare the same questions across results from different countries and different years. When adding a new question, please follow the format for the Code, which is:

```<short description><number><country code>```

* **question**: The question in English as presented to the participant.

* **answer_format**: This describes the format of the answers to the question. There are different options:

   * `Y/N/NA`: Yes or No format (with optional N/A when applicable)
   * `FREETEXT`: An open text based answer added by the participant
   * `FREENUMERIC`: A field where participant can encode any number
   * `DATETIME`: A field that only date can be chosen
   * `ONE CHOICE`: A list of answers the participant can choose from
   * `MULTIPLE CHOICE`: A list of answers the participant can choose from. (S)He can choose as many as (s)he wants.
   * `LIKERT`: any type of likert scale.
   * `RANKING`: A list of answers the participants need to rank in order

* **answer_file**: This column gives the name of the csv file located in `listAnswers` folder, where the appropriate answers options are stored.

* **order_question**: Boolean column to know if the order of the answer should be following the answers given in the answer_file of should be orderd according to the question numbers.

* **conditional**: This indicates whether a question only appears if an specific answer was given to a previous question.

* **other**: Indicates when a field 'other' needs to be added to the answers. Works only for the some type of questions ('one choice', 'multiple choice'). The only value it can takes is 'Y'. There is no need to specify anything when 'other' is not wanted.

* **random**: Indicate that the questions need to be randomised. Works only when several questions sharing the same `answer_file` AND the same `code` (without including the number) AND if the questions is 'Y/N/NA' or 'Likert. The only value it can takes is 'Y'. There is no need to specify anything when 'other' is not wanted.

* **source**: If a specific resource (e.g. a list on Wikipedia, a government policy doc, etc.) was used to generate a list of potential answers, please reference it here.

* **comment**: Any comments that you wish to make.

* **lang_trans{1-3}**: Column to write down the translation of the question.

# Organisation of the repository

* analysis: a directory containing Jupyter notebooks covering the results of the analysis from each country and year
* survey_creation: files and dirs used to create surveys for new countries or for new years

# Technical solution

We decided to use the open source [limesurvey](http://www.limesurvey.org) service to create the survey. This solution presents advantages in term of price and variety of hosting solutions. It also makes it is easier to share survey templates that can be later modified by each organisation/country. The template is in [template/](./templates').

The collaboration will be done on this repository to ensure access to the information for every one and respect the principle of transparency. However, on early stage, the repository is going to be set up on *private mode* until everyone agrees on going on *public*.
