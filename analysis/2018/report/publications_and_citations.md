# Publications and citations

RSEs is an hybrid role between a researcher and a software developer. We
investigated both of these aspects concerning publication and dissemination of
their work, one on the traditional aspect of it (publications and conference).

One essential aspect of career in academia is the publications and the
conferences to gain recognition. However, the role of RSE being less about
writing articles than creating the infrastructure and the software for the
article to exist, there is some fear that they will fail to have recognition
through the papers and conferences.

Questions in the section:

* In general, when your software contributes to a paper, are you acknowledged
  in that paper? (one choice)
* Have you presented your software work at a conference or workshop? (yes-no)
* At which conference(s)/workshop(s) have you presented your software work?
