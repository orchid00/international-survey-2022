# Loading dataset
To find the total number of participants, we took all submissions and then removed those from people who were outside the country (see question 1) and those from people who had not completed the first ten questions (i.e. those people who did not complete the first page of the survey).

# Section 1. Social demographic
In this section, we determine some information about the demographics of the respondents: country of work, qualification, gender, age, ethnic origin, salary, and disabilities.

## Country of work
The data was cleaned to remove all participants that were not working in South Africa.
### In which country do you work?

## Qualifications
The highest proportion of RSEs hold a *doctorate* (68%) as their highest qualification but only by a margin when compared to *master degree* (23%).

Most RSEs derive from a background in *Physics and Astronomy* (55%). None of the other field contain more than 1 participant (except the possibility *Other*).

### What is the highest qualification you have obtained?
### In which subject is your highest academic qualification?

## Gender
Only one participants answered *Female* to the question of gender while 92% of the participant (n=12) reported to be *Male*. 9 (over 22) participants did not answer that question.

### Please select your gender

## Age
The age of the participants are concentrated in the two lowest age ranges, the *25 to 34 years* (38%, n=5) and the *35 to 44 years* (38%, N=5).

### Please select your age

## Ethnic origin
The participants are predominantly white (92%, n=12), only one participant reported being black.


### How would you describe your ethnic origin? This refers to people who share the same cultural background and identity, not country of birth or nationality.

## Salary
Almost half of the RSE in South Africa earn *Between R 708 311 and R 1 500 000* (46%, n=6), while the second highest range of salary is *Between R 296 541 and R 410 460* (23%, n=3).

### Please select the range of your annual salary

## Disability
No participant reported any form of disability.

### Do you have a condition that is defined as a disability by the White Paper on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2015)

## Professional qualifications
### Do you hold any other professional degrees/qualifications? (Please enter each of them separated by a semicolon)


# Section 2: Questions about coding
In this section we investigate the relationship between RSEs and the code they develop.

As expected, the vast majority of RSEs (86%, n=19) write code. 15% (n=3) of the participants write code for themselves while the vast majority write code for other people (85%, n=17).

However, despite the majority of them writing code, only 23% (n=5) consider themselves as *professional software developer*. This is a low number when we consider the average time of developing software (14 years) and that they are mainly developing software for others.

Surprisingly, the participants do not spend much of their time coding, but doing research. Software development come only second in the most time consuming task. The second type of question asked if the participants wanted to spend more time than what they do. Here again, the participants seems to want to spend more time doing research. Again, software development comes second. They are mainly coming from the North-West University and the University of Pretoria (40%, n=4 and 20%, n=2) but 12 participants did not answer to that question.


### Do you write code as part of your job?
### Who uses the code that you write?
### Do you consider yourself a professional software developer?
### How many years of Software development experience do you have?
### In an average month, how much time do you spend on software development (Please rate your answer between 1 to 10. 1 Being none at all and 10 being All your time.); In an average month, how much time do you spend on Research; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Management; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Teaching; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Other activities

### In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on programming? (Please rate your answer between 1 to 10. 1 Being none at all and 10 being All your time.); In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Research; In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Management; In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Teaching


# Section 3: Questions about employment

The participants work principally for an university (45%, n=10) and for research organisation (32%, n=7).
They work in more different field than they come from. The majority still works in Physics and Astronomy (29%, n=12) but several of them are working in Computer Science (12%, n=5), Mathematics (10%, n=4) and Education (7%, n=3).

### What type of organisation do you work for?
### Which University? Please please provide the full official name of the university or organisation e.g. University of Cape Town if your organisation is not listed
### Which organisation do you work for?
### What is your official job title?
### Are you known by a different job title? If so, please enter the job title you use
### In which disciplines do you work (select as many as apply)


# Section 4: Questions about the type of contract

Almost all the participants are employed under full time contract (82%, n=18) and they are mainly Permanent (either funded by University core funding, or as long as funding is available. But this apparent stability in contract has to be tempered with the average length of the contract (5 years). On the origin of their funding (which 72%, n=13 of the participants know the origin), it seems that the type of funding is not applicable for them (40%, n=4) or that it comes from Grants (30%, n=3).  This is the method of Grants that is also privilegied as funding process for their current larger project (50%, n=5) and for their previous largest project too (50%, n=5).


### Do you work full time or part time
### What type of contract are you employed on?
### What is the total duration of your current employment (in years)?
### Do you know the source of the funding used to support you and your current, largest project?
### Which of the following sources are used to pay for your effort as an RSE/equivalent?
### Which of the following sources are used to fund your current, largest project?
### Which of the following sources were used to fund your current, largest project three years ago?


# Section 5: Questions about previous employment
Several questions were about the participants previous job. The idea is to collect insight of their career and understand what are their motivation to be an RSE.

More than a half of the participants worked in a university prior to their current position (59%, n=13), added to this majority, 9%, n=2 come from Research organisation.
At least 14%, n=3 shift career and moved from the private sector to academy and for 18%, n=4 it is their first job.

We asked the participants to rank the reasons why they chose their actual position among 8 different ones:
* Desire to work in a research environment
* Freedom to choose own working practices
* Desire to advance research
* I want to learn new skills
* Opportunity to develop software
* Flexible working hours
* Ability to work across disciplines
* Opportunity for career advancement
* The salary

It appears that the Desire to advance research, and the Ability to work across disciplines are the biggest reasons why the RSE chose their current position.
On the contrary, the salary and the Opportunity to develop software are the least common reasons for choosing a position as RSE. The lack of interest in developing software was also visible when we asked them in which activity they would spend more of their time.

### Rank the following factors dependent on how strongly they influenced your decision to accept your current position
