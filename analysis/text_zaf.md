# Loading dataset
To find the total number of participants, we took all submissions and then removed those from people who were outside the country (see question 1) and those from people who had not completed the first ten questions (i.e. those people who did not complete the first page of the survey).

# Section 1. Social demographic
In this section, we determine some information about the demographics of the respondents: country of work, qualification, gender, age, ethnic origin, salary, and disabilities.

## Country of work
The data was cleaned to remove all participants that were not working in South Africa.
### In which country do you work?

## Qualifications
The highest proportion of RSEs hold a *doctorate* (68%) as their highest qualification but only by a margin when compared to *master degree* (23%).

Most RSEs derive from a background in *Physics and Astronomy* (55%). None of the other field contain more than 1 participant (except the possibility *Other*).

### What is the highest qualification you have obtained?
### In which subject is your highest academic qualification?

## Gender
Only one participants answered *Female* to the question of gender while 92% of the participant (n=12) reported to be *Male*. 9 (over 22) participants did not answer that question.

### Please select your gender

## Age
The age of the participants are concentrated in the two lowest age ranges, the *25 to 34 years* (38%, n=5) and the *35 to 44 years* (38%, N=5).

### Please select your age

## Ethnic origin
The participants are predominantly white (92%, n=12), only one participant reported being black.


### How would you describe your ethnic origin? This refers to people who share the same cultural background and identity, not country of birth or nationality.

## Salary
Almost half of the RSE in South Africa earn *Between R 708 311 and R 1 500 000* (46%, n=6), while the second highest range of salary is *Between R 296 541 and R 410 460* (23%, n=3).

### Please select the range of your annual salary

## Disability
No participant reported any form of disability.

### Do you have a condition that is defined as a disability by the White Paper on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2015)

## Professional qualifications
### Do you hold any other professional degrees/qualifications? (Please enter each of them separated by a semicolon)


# Section 2: Questions about coding
In this section we investigate the relationship between RSEs and the code they develop.

As expected, the vast majority of RSEs (86%, n=19) write code. 15% (n=3) of the participants write code for themselves while the vast majority write code for other people (85%, n=17).

However, despite the majority of them writing code, only 23% (n=5) consider themselves as *professional software developer*. This is a low number when we consider the average time of developing software (14 years) and that they are mainly developing software for others.

Surprisingly, the participants do not spend much of their time coding, but doing research. Software development come only second in the most time consuming task. The second type of question asked if the participants wanted to spend more time than what they do. Here again, the participants seems to want to spend more time doing research. Again, software development comes second. They are mainly coming from the North-West University and the University of Pretoria (40%, n=4 and 20%, n=2) but 12 participants did not answer to that question.


### Do you write code as part of your job?
### Who uses the code that you write?
### Do you consider yourself a professional software developer?
### How many years of Software development experience do you have?
### In an average month, how much time do you spend on software development (Please rate your answer between 1 to 10. 1 Being none at all and 10 being All your time.); In an average month, how much time do you spend on Research; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Management; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Teaching; In an average month, how much time do you spend on Other activities

### In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on programming? (Please rate your answer between 1 to 10. 1 Being none at all and 10 being All your time.); In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Research; In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Management; In an average month, how much time would you like to spend on Teaching


# Section 3: Questions about employment

The participants work principally for an university (45%, n=10) and for research organisation (32%, n=7).
They work in more different field than they come from. The majority still works in Physics and Astronomy (29%, n=12) but several of them are working in Computer Science (12%, n=5), Mathematics (10%, n=4) and Education (7%, n=3).

### What type of organisation do you work for?
### Which University? Please please provide the full official name of the university or organisation e.g. University of Cape Town if your organisation is not listed
### Which organisation do you work for?
### What is your official job title?
### Are you known by a different job title? If so, please enter the job title you use
### In which disciplines do you work (select as many as apply)


# Section 4: Questions about the type of contract

Almost all the participants are employed under full time contract (82%, n=18) and they are mainly Permanent (either funded by University core funding, or as long as funding is available. But this apparent stability in contract has to be tempered with the average length of the contract (5 years). On the origin of their funding (which 72%, n=13 of the participants know the origin), it seems that the type of funding is not applicable for them (40%, n=4) or that it comes from Grants (30%, n=3).  This is the method of Grants that is also privilegied as funding process for their current larger project (50%, n=5) and for their previous largest project too (50%, n=5).


### Do you work full time or part time
### What type of contract are you employed on?
### What is the total duration of your current employment (in years)?
### Do you know the source of the funding used to support you and your current, largest project?
### Which of the following sources are used to pay for your effort as an RSE/equivalent?
### Which of the following sources are used to fund your current, largest project?
### Which of the following sources were used to fund your current, largest project three years ago?


# Section 5: Questions about previous employment
Several questions were about the participants previous job. The idea is to collect insight of their career and understand what are their motivation to be an RSE.

More than a half of the participants worked in a university prior to their current position (59%, n=13), added to this majority, 9%, n=2 come from Research organisation.
At least 14%, n=3 shift career and moved from the private sector to academy and for 18%, n=4 it is their first job.

We asked the participants to rank the reasons why they chose their actual position among 8 different ones:
* Desire to work in a research environment
* Freedom to choose own working practices
* Desire to advance research
* I want to learn new skills
* Opportunity to develop software
* Flexible working hours
* Ability to work across disciplines
* Opportunity for career advancement
* The salary

It appears that the Desire to advance research, and the Ability to work across disciplines are the biggest reasons why the RSE chose their current position.
On the contrary, the salary and the Opportunity to develop software are the least common reasons for choosing a position as RSE. The lack of interest in developing software was also visible when we asked them in which activity they would spend more of their time.

### Where was your previous job based?
### Rank the following factors dependent on how strongly they influenced your decision to accept your current position


# Section 6: Collaboration and training
RSEs do not work for themselves, their role involves writing code that is used by others (as seen in section 2), but the collaboration can take other forms. This is why we asked with whom the participants work with. Usually, they seems to be embedded in a stable group, 58% (n=11) of them report to work with the same researchers, while a minority has a more flexible collaboration (42%, n=8).
On the side of collaboration, we wanted to know if they were working within a stable group of researcher software. It appears they are not embedded in any research group for the majority of them (79%, n=15). However, they are working in team were other fellow developers are involved. In average they have 2 other fellow developers in their team, often coming from the same institution (42%, n=8).
Working for researchers or working within a research software group is different than working on the same project with other developers. On average they work on 3 different projects at the same time.

RSEs have programming skills that is not necessarily shared within their field. Therefore, they can train other researchers to develop some best practices or learn how to program more efficiently. Half of the participants provide such training (50%, n=9). They are not teaching directly to students but transferring skills is an important aspect of their job. In average, they do training twice a year. These trainings are more often done under the form of workshop or the software carpentry program than traditional teaching. A type of training probably more adapted to teach computing skills.

## Collaboration
### Do you always work with the same researcher(s), or do you regularly change the researcher(s) you work with?
### Do you work for a Research Software Group?
### How many programmers are in your team - 1 means you are the only person?
### If you have more than 1 fellow programmer in your team, where are they from?
### How many software projects are you currently involved in?

## Training
### Have you ever trained researchers in computational techniques?
### On average, how many times a year do you take part in providing training?
### What training programs are you involved with (comma separated list) (For example, Software Carpentry, local university training, etc.)


# Section 7: Publications

RSEs is an hybrid role between a researcher and a software developer. We investigated both of these aspects concerning publication and dissemination of their work, one on the traditional aspect of it (publications and conference) and on the more software aspect (open source and DOI).
One essential aspect of career in academia is the publications and the conferences to gain recognition. However, the role of RSE being less about writing articles than creating the infrastructure and the software for the article to exist, there is some fear that they will fail to have recognition through the papers and conferences.
Our results support this idea, while for 74% (n=14) of the participants, their software is used in published researches they are only 42% (n=8) (among them) who are acknowledged in the publication.

Among these participants that are acknowledged in the paper, only 38% (n=3) are generally named as main author for the paper. Among the 62% of those who are not main author, they are at least mentioned as co-authors (100%, n=5).
On conference, the number of RSEs that present their work in conference is rather small, only 26% (n=5), when compared to the paper publications.

One important development practice is how the code is distributed and if the RSEs are releasing their work under open licence.
We asked the participants if they have ever released their work under open source licence and 44% (n=8) of them replied by the affirmative. Among these RSEs that publish data under open source licence, the majority of them are using it more often than not (76% n=6) and prefer the licence *Apache Licence 2.0* and the *BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" licence" to do so (50%, n=6).

However, they rarely use a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to help to identify their software, only 11%, n=2 of them are doing it. And the frequency of use of the DOI among them is much more variable than for the open licence.

## Academic publications
### Has your software contributed to research that has been published in a journal or at a conference?; In general, when your software contributes to a paper, are you acknowledged in that paper?; Are you generally named as the main author of the paper?; Are you generally named as a co-author of the paper?
### Have you ever presented your software work at a conference or workshop?
### Which conference(s)/workshop(s) (Please write a comma separated list with FULLNAME and ACRONYM)

## Open source
### Have you ever released your software under an open-source licence?
### How often do you release the software projects you've worked on under an open-source licence?
### Which open source licences do you prefer to use for your software?
### Have you ever used a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to identify your software?
### How often do you associate your software with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)?


# Section 8: Sustainability and technical details

This section comprises two subsections that focus on the technical and development aspects of the RSEs' work. They aim to understand good practices in developing software and which tools are important for RSEs.

Developing software requires a set of good practices to ensure the quality of the subsequent analysis as well as the robustness of the developed software, to name a few of important aspects. We wanted to see if the implementation of some simple but essential good practices were a reality. Three measures were created, the implementation of testing, the bus factor and the technical hand over plan.
These metrics allows to see the importance of the RSEs role in their team but also if they are themselves implementing some practices that are used widely in industry but less in academic research.

We asked the participants to choose any of the following testing methods:
* Test engineers conduct testing
* Developers conduct testing
* Users conduct testing
* No formal testing

Obviously, the *test engineers conduct testing* is the most potential testing method but may not be possible in number of small projects while, no formal testing should not occur in any ideal scenario, regardless of the size of the project.

24% (n=7) of the participants confessed they were not implementing any testing at all. It may seems a low number but we think it is still a high percentage considering the specific work of this population. When they are conducting testing, the RSEs seems to prefer (or only able to implement) *developer testing* (41% of them, n=12) or letting the users conduct the testing (28%, n=8), while the use of test engineers is marginal (7%, n=2).

We chose two broad measures to provide an insight into sustainability: the bus factor and technical hand over planning. The bus factor is a measure of the number of developers who understand a specific software project and could, with only a cursory review of the project, maintain or extend the code. A project with a bus factor of 1 is completely reliant on only one developer. If this developer finds new employment, becomes ill or is hit by the titular bus, then the project will fail. A high bus factor provides some confidence that the project can be sustained even if a developer leaves. A technical hand over plan is used to introduce a new developer to a software project. These plans cover basic information, such as the licence and location of the software, a repository, a description of the software architecture, a summary of development plans and any other information that a new developer would need to understand the software. A project that has written (and maintained) a technical hand over plan can withstand the departure of a developer, even a key developer, significantly better than one without such a plan.

On a vast majority of the RSEs' projects the bus factor is 1 (78%, n=14), higher bus factors are only marginal. The presence of a technical plan can mitigate the low bus factor in the different projects. But this presence is really low (11%, n=2) and presents a risk of project failures.

On a more positive note about sustainability, it appears that a large majority of the participants use a version control (76%, n=16) and mainly GIT (62%, n=13).
They also extensively use collaboration tools (97%, n=17), they mostly use Github (60%, n=12) but some are using Institutional Repository (15%, n=3) or Bitbucket (10%, n=2). They also extensively use collaboration online tools to communicate with their project groups, mainly Slack.

On technical details we wanted to know which of the programming languages are mostly used by the RSEs. We give them a multi-choice list inspired by the [results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-popular-technologies) published by Stackoverflow. Python is clearly the most used language (22%, n=9) followed by SQL (10%, n=4) and R (10%, n=4).
About which Operating System used by RSEs, a majority are using GNU/Linux (46%, n=6), while Windows and OS X have way less users (31%, n=4 and 23%, n=3).

### In general, what sort of testing do you conduct on your software? (check all that apply)
### What is the bus factor of your most important software project? (the bus factor is the number of team members who, if run over by a bus, would put the project in jeopardy, so 1 means the project is dependent on a single person)

# Section 9: Job satisfaction

The job satisfaction is an essential pulse to take about the community. It helps to track the evolution and the current state of the RSEs within their role and to catch any sign of structural or organisational dysfunction that are translated into well-being. There are a lot of different metrics to measure the quality of a job on a personal and psychological level [4]. Several models exist to understand the link between different factors of job satisfaction and turnover intention [5]–[9]. Turnover intention is an important measure that is highly associated with the risk of employees leaving the organisation [7]. Job satisfaction is important in retaining RSEs. Perceived employability provides information on how workers values their own skills in regard of the market. To measure the different attitudes toward the RSE role, we used scales that have been created in [5], [6], [8], [9]. These are Likert scale [10], which are 5 point ordinal scales graduated from Strongly disagree to Strongly agree. Each scale is composed of several so called items (i.e. questions) that each measure one attitude.

Beside these specific concepts we asked more general question about their satisfaction in their current position and their satisfaction with their career in general with a range of answers from *0 - Not at all satisfied* to *10 - Completely satisfied*. 69% of the participants answered more than 5 to the scale (which can be considered as a neutral position) to the question about their satisfaction about their current position. For the question about their satisfaction with their career in general (and using the same scale), only one participants answered 0, the rest of the participants answered at least 5.

The specific questions about their job satisfaction reflect, in general, the same opinion as the two more generic questions. However, the granularity helps to identify a several issues that would not appears with generic questions:

* *The feedback about the performance*: These questions ask if the RSEs feel that they receive enough information about their work and their performance. While they seems to have enough information about the purpose of their work and having access to sufficient data and information, they are less assertive about the feedback they receive from their colleagues and their supervisors, mainly from the supervisors.

* *The turnover intention*: These questions aim to measure the desire to quit their current position. Overall, the participants are not willing to leave their position and are not necessarily searching for other job, even if the potential job would offer the same compensations. However, these positive signals about their job are tempered by the low score on the question "How often do you look forward to another day at work?".

* *The perceived employability*: This concept is linked to the previous one. People may not have the intention to leave their jobs, not because they like it, but because they fear they are not employable. This is not the case here, the participants consider themselves more often employable than not.=

* *The affective recognition*: This concept try to see if the participants receive positive feedback from their supervisors. Overall, again the participants report a positive relation with their supervisors. It means they are not systematic issues with direct management.

* *Affective satisfaction*: Here, the concept measures how much the participants enjoy and like their job. The answers were positive and again, reflect the answers given at the more generic questions.

* *The possibility of progression*: This question aims to study the possibility of evolution for the RSEs, if information is available and if they see a possibility of evolution within their current career. This is the only questions that clearly received negative answers. To summarise, even if the RSEs have planned to be in this position, as a part of their career plan, the majority of them think they cannot be promoted in their current group. Also, it seems unlikely their next position will be an RSE role which can be translate into a higher turnover in the following year. This risk is aggravated by the low bus factor and the absence of technical hand-over plan (see section 8).


## General satisfaction
### In general, how satisfied are you with your current position; In general, how satisfied are you with your career

## Feedback about performance
### Do you receive sufficient information on the results of your work?; Does your work give you the opportunity to check on how well you are doing your work?; In your work, do you have access to sufficient data and information?; Do you receive sufficient information on the purpose of your work?; Does your work provide you with direct feedback on how well you are doing your work?; Does your supervisor/line manager inform you about how well you are doing your work?; Do your colleagues inform you about how well you are doing your work?

## Turnover intention
### How often do you feel frustrated when not given the opportunity to achieve your personal work-related goals?; How often do you look forward to another day at work?; How often do you consider leaving your job?; How often do dream about getting another job that will better suit your needs?
### My current job satisfies my personal needs; I would accept another job at the same compensation level if I was offered it

## Perceived employability
### It would not be very difficult for me to get an equivalent job in a different organisation; I can think of a number of organisations that would probably offer me a job; My experience is in demand on the labour market; Given my qualifications and experience, getting a new job would not be very hard at all

## Affective recognition
### I am satisfied with my supervisor/line manager's confidence in me; I am satisfied with a word of thanks from my supervisor/line manager; I am satisfied with the recognition I receive from my supervisor/line manager for doing my job; I am satisfied with the compliments from my supervisor/line manager concerning my work; I am satisfied with the encouragement from my supervisor/line manager while doing my job

## Affective satisfaction
### I find real enjoyment in my job; Most days I am enthusiastic about my job; I feel fairly well satisfied with my job; I like my job better than the average person

## Possibility of progression
### It is likely that I will gain a promotion within my current group; The process I have to complete to gain a promotion is clear and understandable; There are many opportunities within my chosen career plan; My current position is an integral part of my career plan; It is likely that my next position will be an RSE role


# Section 10: Research Software Engineer

This last section regroups different questions about RSEs in general, the specific skills for them, where they meet other RSEs and the prospect of a conference in Germany. We asked them *how* they acquired the skills to become an RSE but also *which* skills they would like to acquire to become a better RSE. The propositions are listed and a wordcloud is proposed to see which are the most frequent words.
It seems the RSE learn their skills on their own through self-teaching or experience.

The last section was about the RSE networkt appears that the network is not really efficient yet. First, to the question where they meet other RSE, only  1 participant met them through the UKRSE Association (which, on later question, none of the participants mention to be part of it).
However, to the question if they would be interested in such organisation in South Africa, 62% (n=8) answered 'Yes'. In which organisation, what they will like the most would be the possibility to network and build a range of collaboration (both in research and software), the interestin training and job opportunities being the less important for them.
## Skills
### How did you learn the skills you need to become an RSE?
### What three skills would you like to acquire or improve to help your work as a Research Software Engineer? The skills can be technical and non-technical.

## RSE network
### How do you meet other RSEs?
### Are you a member of the UK RSE Association? (Members are people who have signed up to the UK RSE mailing list)
### Would you be interested in joining such an organisation if one was formed in South Africa?
### What would you hope to get out of such an organisation (check all that apply)?
